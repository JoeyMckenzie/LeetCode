# LeetCode

=======================================================
~~~ Solutions for C#, Ruby, and JavaScript ~~~
=======================================================

The following directories contain my solutions to various programming questions
from LeetCode. Timing for program execution is included within each solution.
Each solution contains a short description of the problem and detailed insight
as to the direction I took to solve each problem. Most problems have been solved
in each C#, Ruby, JavaScript, and I will eventually get around to adding more solutions
to each language directory (keyword: eventually).

If there are ways you might suggest to better optimize these solutions, or just
discuss the various solutions, please feel free to contact me at joey32793@gmail.com.
